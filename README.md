# 💳 Fake Credit Card Generator
This is a glorified random number generator made in Python. It does not use the Luhn Algorithm Check. It generates random strings of numbers and then gives the input onto a website to check if it is legitimate. This does not mean the card will be valid. There is an extremely low chance of the card even belonging to something as there is more than just the number. All code can be seen and please let me know if there are ways to make it more efficient as I am learning to code.

## ✅ **Done:**
- Companies that use 16 digit cards.
