# CC-Gen

This is a glorified random number generator made in Python. It generates random strings of numbers and then gives the input onto a website to check if it is legitimate. This does not mean the card will be valid. There is an extremely low chance of the card even belonging to something as there is more than just the number. All code can be seen and please let me know if there are ways to make it more efficient as I am learning to code.

This is an educational project for me to learn coding. It shall not be used for malicious purposes. I do not promote my tools. I do not take responsibility for any bad usage of this tool.
